Automate whatsapp responses


Using selenium we can automatically answer whatsapp texts as long as we keep the whatsapp web tab open. I can see a few uses for this from a business perspective, but my main goal with this is to be able to send links to 
videos from facebook, youtube etc. to this bot and have it reply with the video in question. Essentially and ad free simple video downloader that uses a familiar platform. For now script.py only responds with text messages
using chrome. firefox.py does the same, but it uses firefox.
